# CREDISY-Online-Banking

  CREDISY is a web application designed to provide an online banking experience. The goal of this project is to showcase and demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. Developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming module at SLIIT, CREDISY offers a secure and user-friendly platform for banking transactions. With features like account management, fund transfers, and transaction history, CREDISY highlights the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in OOP.
